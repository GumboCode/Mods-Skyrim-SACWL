## About

This mod simply allows you to add more carry weight to your current limit using a spell that opens an option menu, it is a dumbed down version of the more configurable MCM. You will find 3 copies of the spell tome around Skyrim, one at Helgen Keep, one at Dragonsreach, and one in the Arcanaeum in the College of Winterhold. It doesn’t modify actor values directly, or edit race entries. Instead, the mod uses an ability that is almost identical to the Extra Pockets perk, but not related. In other words, it should be compatible with other carry weight mods, even the MCM version of this mod.

## Features

- Cast a spell to access a menu that lets you select an initial value to increase your weight by, 100, 1K, 10K, 100K, 1M.

- After you select a base amount, then you select by how much to multiply the amount up to 10 times.

- Selecting the disable option will completely remove the effect from the player for easy clean up.

<ins>Current limitations:</ins>

- This mod is not able to reduce your carry weight below its normal value, though I can certainly look into that in the future if anyone expresses interest.
- You can only set your own carry weight, it doesn’t affect your companions.
- You cannot set your carry weight to be any higher than 10M because it will start to negatively impact anything else giving you carry weight bonuses. I.g. It can give your Extra Pockets perk permanent reductions.
